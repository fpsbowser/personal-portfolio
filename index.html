            Ever since I was a kid I've had an iterest in tech. It started in
            late 2008 when I was 11, I was able to get my hands on the original
            iPhone (thanks mom and dad)! Then it escalated rather quickily by me
            building my first gaming computer at 13 years old, achieving the
            family title of "The Computer Kid" and am still to this day the tech
            support for all my family and friends! After I graduated highscool I
            started my journey in the programming world.
          </p>

            I started out learning the Swift language and built a few mobile
            apps, which I really enjoyed but after a samll hiatus I took a
            detour to JavaScript and that's when things got real. Using The Odin
            Project as my bootcamp and learning structure, I dedicated all my
            time to it. I finished the whole curriculum and learned an unfathom
            amount of information and was able to build fun and unique projects,
            showcased below.
